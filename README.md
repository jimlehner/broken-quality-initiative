# The Broken Quality Initiative Repository
Welcome to the official GitHub repository of The Broken Quality Initiative [www.brokenquality.com](https://www.brokenquality.com/). Here, you'll find the datasets and (eventually) code associated with the essays found at [www.brokenquality.com/bookshelf](https://www.brokenquality.com/bookshelf).

The datasets found in the data folder use the following naming convetion:

**essay_name-dataset_name**

As an example, the dataset associated with the essay **Network Analysis: Advancing the utility of SPC** has the name **network_analysis_advancing_spc-manufacturing_process_data**.

## Essays
The essays on The Broken Quality Initiative Bookshelf include:
- `The definition of quality`: Quality has become an overused term of little substance. This essay is about how the current state of quality came to be and what we can do to fix it. There is no dataset associated with this essay. [The definition of quality](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/67a11f3deb559c2a30f66348/1738612541895/The+definition+of+quality.pdf)
- `Understanding the process capability indices`: The process capability indices have become a standard method by which processes are graded. This essay explains the process capability indices and the context that is required to put them to use. [Understanding the process capability indices](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/67a113ff741c0305cbcaf1db/1738609665034/Understanding+the+process+capability+indices.pdf)
- `On writing, reports, & process behavior charts`: An essay outlining the advantages of written reports over PowerPoint. [On writing, reports, & process behavior charts](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/678682b0985aa0078fb3b983/1736868529394/On-writing-reports-and-process-behavior-charts.pdf)
- `Network Analysis: Advancing the utility of SPC`: Network analysis updates the tried and true methods of Statistcal Process Control (SPC) and process behavior charts (control charts) such that they reflect the modern business and industrial ecosystems. [Network Analysis: Advancing the utility of SPC](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/679910513be40134de9b54f7/1738084433790/Network+analysis.pdf)
- `What the spec?`: An essay explaining the practical differences of process limits and specification limits. [What the spec?](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/67a12bc5d98a6f4c49d1a4a4/1738615750105/What+the+spec.pdf)
- `The importance of context: How process behavior charts imbue meaning`: Without context, data is random and miscellaneous. This essay articulates how process behavior charts establish context and imbue meaning better than any other method or tool. [The importance of context](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/67a61713095e3d696e01d614/1738938132289/The+importance+of+context.pdf)
- `Poverty & Improvement`: Process behavior charts (control charts) are not limited to industrial applications. This essay serves as an example of the process behavior charts utility to social problems. [Poverty & Improvement](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/67a61be65845e420dcc8c0b3/1738939366795/Poverty+and+improvement.pdf)
- `Network analysis of supplier on-time delivery`: On-Time Delivery (OTD) is a common supplier quality metric. This essay expands on the utility of OTD using a network analysis. [Network analysis of supplier on-time delivery](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/67a635232700da46098b6d60/1738945828468/Network+analysis+of+supplier+on+time+delivery.pdf)
- `Supplier Quality Ratios`: Manufacturing in modern industry is often executed across global networks of suppliers and customers. This essay outlines an alternative method for understanding supplier quality. [Supplier Quality Ratios](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/6789790261af002ec3b0edd6/1737062659434/Supplier-quality-ratios.pdf) 
- `Same parts, new supplier`: This essay serves as an example of how to evaluate legacy parts produced by a new supplier. [Same parts, new supplier](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b722db6f2e6b1ad5053391b/t/67a64c21fe4e8d2763b7aa06/1738951714572/Same+parts+new+supplier.pdf)

## About The Broken Quality Initiative
The Broken Quality Inititiave aims to address industries pervasive lack of knowledge of variation of variation and the only tool capable of making sense of variation, the process behavior chart (control chart).

This lack of knowledge is reflected in the often haphazard, disorganized, and chaotic way methods that individuals, teams, and organizations use to improve quality and reduce costs. Rather than work to understand and eliminate the sources of variation that make processes unpredictable, inordinate amounts of time and attention are dedicated to gut feelings and guess work. While this sentiment is often accompanied by best efforts and hard work, the lack of theory to guide actions reliably digs the hole deeper.  

Since the mid-1920s, with the seminal work of Dr. Walter Shewhart at Bell Labs, a method and tool capable of making sense of data has been at our fingertips. It is due time that industry put to work what Shewhart discovered more than 100 years ago. It is due time that individuals, teams, and organizations learn to turn data into insights and insights into actions that result in change using process behavior charts.
