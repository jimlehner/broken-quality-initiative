The files in this repository provide users with a practical introduction to making senes of data and understand variation using Microsoft Excel. For those new to process behavior charts and understanding variation, it is recommended that users explore the files in this repository in the following sequence:

## Files
- **HowToBuildAnXmRChart.xlsx**: This file provides users with step-by-step instructions on how to build an XmR chart in Excel. The XmR chart is the easiests to construct and most useful type of process behavior chart. The fundamentals in this file will make the user aware of the the forumulas used to calculate process limits and the construction of the XmR chart.
- **TheRightAndWrongWayToCalculateProcessLimits.xlsx**: This file provides users with an example of the practical differences that result from calculating process limits the right way, using the 2.660 and 3.268 scaling factors and average moving range, and the wrong way, using three-times the standard deviation. Understanding these differences are essential and should not be overlooked.
- **XmRChartSoftwareVerification.xlsx**: This file provides users with a dataset that can be used to evaluate if software-calculate process limits are calculated correctly, using the 2.660 and 3.268 scaling factors and average moving range. 

## Filing Bugs
Although we strive to realize it, we know perfection is difficult to attain. If you encounter any issues or errors in the book or code samples, please don't hesitate to file a bug in the [Issues](https://github.com/jimlehner/broken-quality-initiative/issues) section of this repository. When filing an issue please include as much detail as possible including the chapter, page, number, descirption of the issue, and, if relevant, a screenshot or code snippet.

## Contributing
Contributions from our readers are welcomed and appreciated. If you've discovered an error or a way to improve the code, feel free to create a pull request. For signficant changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes. 

## About The Broken Quality Initiative
**The Broken Quality Inititiave** aims to address industries pervasive lack of knowledge of variation of variation and the only tool capable of making sense of variation, the process behavior chart (control chart).

The lack of knowledge of variation is reflected in the often haphazard, disorganized, and chaotic way  individuals, teams, and organizations attempt to improve quality and reduce costs. Rather than work to understand and eliminate the sources of variation that make processes unpredictable, inordinate amounts of time and attention are dedicated to gut feelings and guess work. While this sentiment is often accompanied by best efforts and hard work, the lack of theory to guide actions reliably digs the hole deeper.  

Since the mid-1920s, with the seminal work of Dr. Walter Shewhart at Bell Labs, a method and tool capable of making sense of data has been at our fingertips. It is due time that industry put to work what Shewhart discovered more than 100 years ago. It is due time that individuals, teams, and organizations learn to turn data into insights and insights into actions that result in change using process behavior charts.
